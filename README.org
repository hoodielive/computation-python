#+TITLE: Computation with Python
*** Python was deliberately designed to transcend complexity 

** Simplicity 
 - Turing Machine 
 - Lambda Calculus

** Limits
 - The Halting Problem (undecidable problem) 
 
** Structure 
  - Turing Equivalence 
  - Chomsky Hierarchy 
      1. Regular Expressions 
      2. Recognize Python 
      3. Recognize C++, Javascript 
      4. Turing-equivalent 
  - Finite state machines
